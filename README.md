# ECC_CSCI_2_Week_16_Hashing_-_Graphs
Week 16 Material: Hashing + Graphs for El Camino College CSCI 2 - Data Structures.

Hashing:
- Open Hashing (Closed Addressing) via Linked List [//theory: complete / implementation: incomplete//]
- Closed Hashing (Open Addressing) via Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, & Double Hashing [//theory: incomplete / implementation: incomplete//]

Graphs:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm [//theory: incomplete / implementation: incomplete//]
